Effective CPU Utilization: 6.2% (0.997 out of 16 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.

    Total Thread Count: 1
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.
